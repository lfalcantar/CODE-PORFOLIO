#My conclusion:
>by Luis Alcantar.

    ##SingleLinkList(head) VS TwoPointerLinkList(front, back)
    Using a linkList with front and back, dramatically reduce the time to add elememts to the list
    
    ##General
    Marge sort is the best way to sort LinkLists, is better than arrays. It does not requird extra space O(n).
